 The module now demonstrates a working frontend-backend integration with dynamically processed input data and corresponding output, including conditional design validation and bolt layout visualization. All inputs like bolt diameter, shear force, and plate thickness are parsed and used in simple capacity-based calculations. The frontend updates accordingly and communicates with the backend via an APIView. The structure is modular and follows clean design principles with reusable components and simulated logic, meeting the stated objectives.
